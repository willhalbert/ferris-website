        </p>
        <p>Thank you for choosing Ferris!</p>
        <p>
          These Terms of Use are effective when you utilize the services of
          Ferris, including our online tools, software, data, and websites
          (“Services”). The Terms encompass any guidelines or policies we

          Please also consult our Privacy Policy to understand how we handle
          personal data.
        </p>

        <h2>1. Registration and Access</h2>
        <p>
          To use Ferris services, you need to be at least 13 years old. Those
          under 18 require consent from a parent or guardian. If accessing
          Ferris on behalf of another individual or entity, ensure you have the
          necessary authority to agree to these Terms for them. When setting up
          an account, provide genuine and comprehensive details. Keep your login
          details confidential and avoid sharing with individuals outside your
          organization. You're accountable for any activity associated with your
          account.
        </p>

        <h2>2. Using Our Services</h2>

          us and our partners.
          <br />
          <strong>(b) Sharing Feedback:</strong> We value any feedback, ideas,
          or suggestions you provide for enhancement. We reserve the right to
          use such feedback without any obligations towards you.
          <br />
          <strong>(c) Service Limitations:</strong> While using Ferris, avoid:
          <br />
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) Violating any individual's rights or
          intellectual property;
          <br />
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) Trying to extract the source code or core
          components of our algorithms or systems;
          <br />
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii) Using the outputs from Ferris to create
          competing services;
          <br />
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iv) Using automated means to access our data
          or outputs without specific permission;
          <br />
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(v) Misrepresenting automated outputs as
          human-generated or contravening our Usage Guidelines;
          <br />
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(vi) Trading or distributing access keys
          without prior permission from us;
          <br />
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(vii) Sending us personal information of
          minors under the age of 13 or any applicable legal age threshold.
          Adhere to any specified limits or guidelines when using Ferris.
          <br />
          <strong>(d) External Services:</strong> Using third-party software or
          services alongside Ferris is governed by the terms of those third
          parties. We aren't liable for issues arising from third-party products
          or services.
        </p>

        <h2>3. Extracted Content & Insights</h2>
        <p>
          <strong>(a) Your Notes and Insights:</strong> You can submit images of
          your notes to Ferris, which will then be processed using OCR (Optical
          Character Recognition) to extract text ("Extracted Text"). This
          Extracted Text may then be enhanced or elaborated using sophisticated
          models like GPT-4, producing "Insights". The Extracted Text and
          Insights together are referred to as "Processed Content". You retain
          ownership of your Extracted Text. As long as you adhere to our
          guidelines, Ferris grants you all rights to use the Insights in any
          way you deem fit, including for commercial purposes. Ferris utilizes
          the Processed Content to enhance the platform, meet legal
          requirements, and uphold our guidelines. It's your responsibility to
          ensure the Processed Content adheres to all laws and our guidelines.
          <br />
          <strong>(b) Consistency in Insights:</strong> Given the nature of
          advanced models, Insights might not always be unique across different
          users. As an illustration, if your notes contain a question like “What
          color is the sky?”, the Insight might state “The sky is blue”. Another
          user might receive a similar Insight for the same question. However,
          Insights produced for other users, even if similar, don't count as
          your Processed Content.
          <br />
          <strong>(c) Enhancing Ferris:</strong> We won't use the specific
          Processed Content from your submissions to refine or improve Ferris.
          However, other general content, not directly obtained from users, may
          be used to enhance the system. Do note that opting out may impact the
          platform's capability to cater specifically to your needs.
          <br />
          <strong>(d) Precision & Reliability:</strong> AI and machine learning
          are dynamic and evolving fields. At Ferris, we continually strive to
          amplify the precision, reliability, and usefulness of our services.
          However, due to the inherent uncertainties in machine learning, there
          may be times when the Insights might not perfectly resonate with
          real-world facts or contexts. It's advisable to cross-check and
          validate the Insights for critical applications or ensure human
          oversight when needed.
        </p>

        <h2>4. Privacy, Safety & Data Integrity</h2>
        <p>
          <strong>(a) Protecting Confidential Insights:</strong> While using
          Ferris, you might come across privileged information pertaining to
          Ferris, its partners, or third-party entities. This information should
          be handled with the same discretion as your own confidential details,
          and used exclusively for purposes aligned with our Terms. Revealing
          this information to outsiders is prohibited. The term "privileged
          information" encompasses undisclosed details which Ferris or its
          allies label as confidential or what should naturally be seen as
          confidential, such as proprietary algorithms or unreleased features.
          Exceptions include details that:
          <br />
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) become public without your involvement;
          <br />
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) were already in your possession without
          any secrecy obligations at the time of receiving through Ferris;
          <br />
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii) are lawfully shared with you by an
          external entity without secrecy constraints; or
          <br />
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iv) you've developed on your own without
          leveraging the confidential details from Ferris. If the law mandates
          the disclosure of such details, ensure you notify Ferris in advance
          and do your best to minimize the extent of the disclosure.
          <br />
          <strong>(b) Safeguarding Access:</strong> Ensure you adopt suitable
          measures to preserve the security of your access to Ferris. If you
          uncover any security loopholes or potential breaches linked to your
          Ferris usage, it's imperative to get in touch with Ferris immediately,
          detailing the situation.
          <br />
          <strong>(c) Handling of Personal Details:</strong> When leveraging
          Ferris to process individual data, you're obligated to provide
          legitimate privacy notices and acquire the required permissions for
          such processing. You're asserting to Ferris that all data processing
          aligns with relevant laws. If you're utilizing Ferris for processing
          data under definitions like GDPR's "personal data" or CCPA's "Personal
          Information", please [fill out this form (form link placeholder)] to
          initiate our Data Processing Agreement.
        </p>
        <h2>5. Responsibility, Service Assurances & Liability Caps</h2>
        <p>
          <strong>(a) Responsibility on Your Part:</strong> You pledge to
          protect, compensate, and keep Ferris, our associates, and our staff
          unharmed against any claims, damages, or expenses (inclusive of legal
          charges) resulting from your engagement with Ferris. This includes the
          content you input, any products or services you develop or advertise
          through Ferris, or any breach of these Terms or contravention of
          relevant laws.
          <br />
          <strong>(b) Service Assurances:</strong> FERRIS IS OFFERED “AS IT
          STANDS.” Unless disallowed by applicable regulations, neither Ferris
          nor its associates provide any guarantees (be it direct, implicit,
          statutory, or other) concerning Ferris, and we refute all assurances.
          This includes but isn't limited to assurances about suitability for
          specific purposes, marketable quality, non-violation of rights,
          uninterrupted services, or the retention and safety of content.
          <br />
          <strong>(c) Capping Our Liability:</strong> IN NO EVENT WILL FERRIS OR
          ITS ASSOCIATES BE HELD LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL,
          EXCEPTIONAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES, INCLUDING DAMAGES
          DUE TO LOSS OF PROFITS, REPUTATION, UTILIZATION, OR DATA. EVEN IF MADE
          AWARE OF THE POTENTIAL FOR SUCH DAMAGES, OUR TOTAL LIABILITY UNDER
          THESE TERMS WON'T SURPASS THE HIGHER OF THE AMOUNT YOU SPENT ON THE
          SPECIFIC FERRIS SERVICE THAT CAUSED THE CLAIM WITHIN THE LAST 12
          MONTHS OR ONE HUNDRED DOLLARS ($100). THE RESTRICTIONS IN THIS CLAUSE
          APPLY TO THE FULLEST EXTENT ALLOWED BY RELEVANT REGULATIONS.
        </p>

        <h2>6. Resolving Disagreements</h2>
        <p>
          <strong>(a) Aiming for Amicable Resolutions:</strong> Before
          considering formal legal action, we urge you and Ferris to seek a
          resolution by discussing any concerns. If any dispute arises from
          these Terms or our services, please start by contacting us with a
          detailed description of your concerns. This ensures we can understand
          and attempt to resolve issues without resorting to legal proceedings.
          <br />
          <strong>(b) Informal Dispute Addressing:</strong> Before initiating
          any claims against Ferris, you're expected to approach the matter
          informally. Send us a detailed account of the dispute and the
          resolution you seek at <strong>tryferris@gmail.com</strong>. If we
          can't reach an understanding within 60 days of receiving your notice,
          you can then consider pursuing other resolution methods.
          <br />
          <strong>(c) Small Claims Court:</strong> Notwithstanding the
          aforementioned, you can always bring any issues before your local
          small claims court, provided those claims qualify for such a venue.
          <br />
          <strong>(d) Class Action Waiver:</strong> Any dispute resolution
          proceedings will be conducted only on an individual basis and not in a
          class or representative action or as a named or unnamed member in a
          class, consolidated, group or representative action.
          <br />
          <strong>(e) Jurisdiction:</strong> Should any legal proceedings arise,
          both parties agree that such proceedings will be conducted in the
          jurisdiction of Ferris's primary place of business, unless another
          location is mutually agreed upon.
          <br />
          <strong>(f) Severability:</strong> If any portion of this Section 8 is
          determined to be unlawful or unenforceable, the remainder of this
          section will remain in full force. Any unenforceable provisions will
          be modified to reflect the parties' intentions while remaining lawful
          and enforceable to the maximum extent permissible.
        </p>

        <h2>7. General Provisions</h2>
        <p>

          any partnership, joint venture, or agency relationship between you and
          William Halbert or Ferris. Both parties operate as independent
          entities, with neither having authority to bind or incur obligations

          <br />
          <strong>(g) Waiver and Enforceability:</strong> Non-action from
          Ferris's side upon any breach of these Terms does not equate to
          waiving our rights. If any part of these Terms is deemed
          unenforceable, the remainder of the Terms will remain intact.
          <br />
          <strong>(h) Export Regulations:</strong> Ensure you comply with all
          relevant export laws and regulations, especially if utilizing Ferris
          services outside the United States.

          or Ferris can seek immediate legal remedies.
          <br />
          <strong>(j) Agreement Integrity:</strong> This document, inclusive of
          any associated policies, constitutes the entire agreement between you
          and Ferris regarding the utilization of services and supersedes any
          previous communications or agreements.
          <br />
          <strong>(k) Governing Law:</strong> These Terms are governed by the
          laws of the State of Florida, excluding any conflicts of law rules.
          Any disputes emerging from these Terms will be addressed exclusively
          in the appropriate courts of Sarasota County, Florida, USA.
